Several revolutions renders the mixture completely clear and \u201cmixed.\u201d If one now reverses the direction of rotation, the colored fluid lines reappear by \u201cunmixing\u201d after the same number of rotations in the opposite sense,\u201d read a presentation posted by the Harvard Natural Sciences Lecture Demonstration.\u00a0\nBecause the slow, steady mixing does not create turbulence, the colors are able to be \u201cunmixed\u201d due to a concept known as laminar flow. In contrast to turbulent flow, where a fluid undergoes irregular mixing, laminar flow allows a liquid to travel smoothly.\nTo visualize the concept, think of a river where the uppermost layer of the water bounces off obstacles like rocks or eddies, causing it to mix and fold unto itself, thus undergoing what is known as turbulent mixing. Below that uppermost layer is the laminar flow, or the part of the water that follows a straight path and does not hit obstacles and become mixed.\u00a0\n\u201cDiffusion processes are, of course, much slower than the time scale of the demonstration. As one cylinder is rotated, the other one can simply think of layers of fluid being displaced without involving turbulence, the boundary layer next to the inner rotating cylinder being displaced the most and the layer adjacent to the outside cylinder the least. Counter rotation slips these layers back into place,\u201d wrote Harvard.\u00a0\nSources\n\u201cHttps://Twitter.Com/Amazing_physics/Status/1453587546278092802.\u201d Twitter, https://twitter.com/amazing_physics/status/1453587546278092802.

The target is the near-Earth asteroid Didymos and its moonlet, Dimorphos, neither of which pose a direct threat to Earth. And it\u2019s all part of a test mission to be conducted by NASA to test the capabilities for redirecting potentially hazardous asteroids in the future.\nNASA announced the upcoming Double Asteroid Reduction Test (DART) mission on Oct. 1 and news outlets like CBS dubbed it an \u201cArmageddon\u201d-like mission.

In the last month, NASA says that 14 known asteroids passed closer to Earth than the moon \u2014 a number that reaches 127 when counting back 365 days.\nThat\u2019s where NASA\u2019s Planetary Defense Coordination Office comes in. This branch is responsible for finding, tracking, and characterizing near-Earth asteroids and objects, and this marks its first attempt at what is called the kinetic impactor technique, which sends a spacecraft like DART to the path of an asteroid to change its motion.\n\u201cDART is our first full-scale attempt to demonstrate that we can change the motion of an asteroid in space, potentially as a way of defending Earth against the hazard of asteroid impacts,\u201d said Tom Statler, a DART scientist, in a podcast interview.\nAsteroids orbit the sun like our home planet does, and when they are in their solar orbit, they do not come near Earth\u2019s orbit or pose a threat. Asteroids that are potentially hazardous are those whose orbits intersect with Earth\u2019s. To find those potential threats, telescopes around the world consistently scan the skies and collect data ultimately compiled by the International Astronomical Union\u2019s (IAU) Minor Planet Center. IAU then determines whether a detected moving object is an asteroid, calibrates its orbit, and figures whether it has the potential to make contact with Earth.\n\nThe #DARTmission is @NASA\u2019s first #PlanetaryDefense test mission and will impact an asteroid to demonstrate a technique that could be used in the future to protect Earth from a potential impact. #CountdownToLaunch on November 24!

And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do with DART. We\u2019re going to demonstrate one technology to cause that deflection that, someday, if we need to, we might use this technology to prevent an asteroid from hitting the Earth,\u201d explained Statler.\nThe half-ton spacecraft will spend the better part of a year transiting to the binary asteroid system, Didymos, which is made up of two asteroids that orbit around each other. Just as the sun holds Earth in its orbit, the half-mile wide asteroid Didymos holds its football stadium-sized moon Dimorphos in orbit. DART is expected to run into the side of this small moon at a high velocity of 4 miles per second to change the motion of the binary asteroid, eventually slowing down and tightening up its orbit around the larger asteroid.\n\u201cOrbits are like donkeys, you pull them one way and they go the other way. So that\u2019s an aspect of this. You hit the thing to slow it down and it ends up going around faster,\u201d explained Statler.\nCurrently, no known asteroid has a chance of impacting Earth in a century, according to Statler, but there could be some we haven\u2019t yet discovered, and science is finding new ones all the time. And because scientists have been observing Didymos for decades, this \u201cnatural laboratory\u201d will help researchers to determine whether systems like DART can move an asteroid and if so, by how much.\n\u201cThe images DRACO returns of the target asteroid Dimorphos, including the last-second glimpse of its own impact site on the asteroid, will be crucial toward analyzing the results of the DART test and understanding how the asteroid was affected,\u201d wrote NASA in a news statement.\nDART is scheduled to launch at 10:20 p.m. PST on Nov. 23 aboard a SpaceX Falcon rocket and ill be live-streamed from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The spacecraft will intercept Didymos\u2019 moonlet in late September 2022 when Didymos is within 6.8 million miles of Earth. And yes, it will be visible to ground-based telescopes.\nSources\nDART. https://dart.jhuapl.edu/.

Unseeable by the human eyes, infrared light is used to view the thermal activity, or heat, of objects to paint a clearer picture of worlds beyond our own.\u00a0\n\u201cIn the center of the image, partially obscured by a dark cloak of dust, a newborn star shoots twin jets of hot gas out into space as a sort of birth announcement to the universe,\u201d said NASA in an article dedicated to the Hubble Telescope\u2019s 30th anniversary.\u00a0\u00a0\nHubble is equipped with multiple cameras and measuring devices that capture images \u2014 but they are all done so in false color, or black and white. To get the vibrant colors seen in photographs taken by the telescope, scientists assign different colors.\u00a0\n\u201cTo summarize, there are things Hubble can\u2019t see that we want to know more about, and we need an infrared telescope to learn about them. Things like: stars and planets being born in clouds of dust and gas; the very first stars and galaxies which are so far away the light they emit has been pushed into the infrared; and the chemical fingerprints of elements and molecules in the atmospheres of exoplanets,\u201d wrote NASA outreach specialist Maggie Masetti.\u00a0\nFound in the Milky Way, our home galaxy, the event photographed is described by NASA as Herbig-Haro Jet HH 24, a bright patch of nebulosity, or a large cloud of gas and dust, associated with newborn stars. These form when narrow jets of partially ionized gas ejected by stars collide with nearby nebulous material.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe photograph showed a star being born in a \u201cturbulent birthing ground\u201d known as Orion B molecular cloud complex, which is located 1,350 light-years from Earth. (A light-year is the measurement of light traveling in a single Earth year, equating one light year to 6 trillion miles.) In the Orion complex, Orion B meets with the neighboring Orion A cloud complex in the constellation of Orion. Over a few million years, thousands of stars have been born in this active dual-cloud area.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen stars form within giant clouds of cool molecular hydrogen, some of the surrounding material collapses under gravity to form a rotating, flattened disk encircling the newborn star,\u201d wrote NASA in a December 2020 blog post accompanying the image.\n\u201cAlthough planets will later congeal in the disk, at this early stage the protostar is feeding on the disk with a voracious appetite. Gas from the disk rains down onto the protostar and engorges it. Superheated material spills away and is shot outward from the star in opposite directions along an uncluttered escape route \u2014 the star\u2019s rotation axis.\u201d\nShocks along these jets heat the surrounding gas to temperatures reaching thousands of degrees Fahrenheit that then collide with surrounding nebulous matter \u201clike a stream of water plowing into a hill of sand.\u201d\u00a0\nNASA launched the school bus-sized telescope in 1990, and in the three decades since, Hubble has been orbiting the earth at a rate of 5 miles per second \u2014 the equivalent of driving a car across North America in 10 minutes. Not only has Hubble seen stars being born, but it has captured stars as they died and planets, stars, and galaxies trillions of miles away. It works by facing towards and photographing space just outside of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which otherwise blocks most of the light from space. This, NASA says, enables the telescope to digitally snap photographs and send them back to Earth using radio waves.\u00a0\nThe successor to Hubble will be the James Webb Space Telescope, the world\u2019s largest and most powerful telescope to be launched in space in December 2021.\u00a0\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough stellar excitement to tide you over until then, here are a few other out-of-this-world images captured by Hubble:\u00a0\nStellar Birth\nCarina Nebula\nPillars of Creation\nStellar Jewelry Box\nStar Eta Carinae\nSources\n\u201cBeholding the Birth and Death of Stars.\u201d HubbleSite.Org, http://hubblesite.org/home/hubble-30th-anniversary/hubbles-exciting-universe/beholding-the-birth-and-death-of-stars.

Additionally, the website for the records indeed lists the Purdue researchers\u2019 \u201cbarium sulphate paint\u201d as the world\u2019s whitest.\nBut that isn\u2019t the paint\u2019s only special quality.\nThe paint made news headlines months earlier in spring 2021, soon after the American Chemical Society published a report\u00a0written by Ruan\u2019s team.\nIn that publication, as well as an April news release by Purdue, the researchers explained how the white paint reflects up to 98.1% of sunlight, and simultaneously sends infrared heat away from its surface \u2014 a process that could help keep buildings cool without so much air conditioning, unlike similarly designed products. (For comparison, other paints that aim to reject heat only reflect 80%-90% of sunlight and do not contain properties to make surfaces cooler than their surroundings, according to the release.)\n\u201cIf you were to use this paint to cover a roof area of about 1,000 square feet, we estimate that you could get a cooling power of 10 kilowatts.

But there are a few caveats to note, namely that this is the second round of attention it has garnered on social media.\u00a0\nThe assisted swimmer video initially made headlines when it was first published in a 2016 issue of the peer-reviewed journal Nano Letters, a publication by the American Chemical Society. The so-called \u201cspermbot\u201d was developed by researchers at the German Institute for Integrative Nanosciences in an effort to find new approaches to addressing infertility.\nLet\u2019s be clear: The technology is a prototype that was recorded propelling immotile sperm toward an oocyte in a petri dish, or in vitro, and not in a living organism. Latin for \u201cwithin the glass,\u201d in vitro studies are performed using biological cells and molecules outside of a living organism. (In vivo, on the other hand, translates to \u201cwithin the living\u201d and refers to work within an organism.)\u00a0\nThe main cause of infertility is low sperm motility or sperm that are otherwise healthy but can\u2019t swim. Cue the spermbot, designed as an alternative to other infertility treatments like artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization. The nanobot consists of a metal helix large enough to wrap around the sperm and uses a rotating magnetic field to latch on to the tail of sperm to \u201cdrive\u201d it into an egg for potential fertilization.\u00a0\nMicromotors like the spermbot are inspired by their natural counterparts and mimic natural processes with the help of human-powered assistance, like magnetic fields. But despite their promise, the precision of delivery, and biocompatibility, the compatibility of nonorganic material with living tissue, remain challenges in the human body.\u00a0\nThe hybrid micromotor uses a spermatozoon as an \u201conboard power supply\u201d and coupled with the microtube that was remote-controlled by an external magnetic field, the sperm tail still provides propulsion for \u201ccellular cargo delivery.\u201d In short, these \u201ccustomized microhelics\u201d serve as motors that can transport sperm cells that have motion deficiencies.\u00a0\n\u201cOur results indicate that metal-coated polymer microhelics are suitable for this task due to potent, controllable, and nonharmful 3D motion behavior,\u201d wrote the study author. \u201cWe manage to capture, transport, and release single immotile live sperm cells in fluidic channels that allow mimicking physiological conditions.\u201d\u00a0\nSuccessful capture, as seen in the video, shows the tail being confined inside the inner part of the microhelix, head sticks out at the front end and is loosely bound by a ring that \u201cacts like a noose to prevent the sperm head from slipping back through the helix.\u00a0\nLimitations in the technology arose when comparing different sperm and egg cells, each of which have to be transferred from culture dishes to another platform for testing that caused delays and temperature fluctuations \u2014 both factors that can influence success rates. Still, the author say their work serves to demonstrate a new approach to artificial reproduction in the future.\n\u201cUnfortunately, similar to many promising applications in biomedical engineering, it appears to be still a long way from artificially motorized sperm delivery to actual oocyte fertilization,\u201d wrote the researchers, adding that the success of this novel approach lies in its potential.\u00a0\nTesting in petri dishes was a \u201cpromising start\u201d that could one day lead to a treatment for male infertility, but required more research before it could be applied to humans, the researchers concluded.\u00a0\n\u201cDespite the fact that there still remain some challenges on the way to achieve successful fertilization with artificially motorized sperms, we believe that the potential of this novel approach toward assisted reproduction can be already put into perspective with the present work,\u201d wrote the study author.\u00a0\nSnopes contacted the researchers to learn more about the current standing of the technology, and whether it may be fit for human testing but did not hear back in time for publication. We will update the article accordingly.\u00a0\nSources\nMedina-S\u00e1nchez, Mariana, et al. \u201cCellular Cargo Delivery: Toward Assisted Fertilization by Sperm-Carrying Micromotors.\u201d Nano Letters, vol. 16, no. 1, Jan. 2016, pp. 555\u201361.

The farmland in Ghent, which is about 37 miles (or 60 kilometers) from Brussels, was the home of Winter \u2014 a 5-year-old llama who spends her days grazing with about 130 of her alpaca and llama friends, according to a 2020 Golden Goose Award\u00a0entry dedicated to her contributions to science.\nBut in addition to those traits, Winter\u2019s immune system supposedly produced a special, very small antibody that, the August 2021 reports claimed, may lead to medical products that could stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, in humans\u2019 immune systems.\n\nIn short, the underlying assertion was this: Researchers had recently injected human test subjects with a formula that included remnants of cells from a llama\u2019s blood to see if, or to what extent, those nonhuman antibodies helped combat SARS-CoV-2.\nThat claim was true, though we\u2019ll provide some important context to make sense of the research.\nYears before the pandemic, Jason McLellan, an associate professor of molecular biosciences at the University of Austin, teamed up with Ghent-based researchers at the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology to study camelids\u2019 antibodies and how they react to immunizations, according to the Golden Goose Award entry. (\u201cCamelids\u201d include camels, alpacas, and llamas.) Their goal: to determine whether, and how, llama\u2019s immune systems could produce antibodies that could be used for medical therapies.\n\u201cWhile humans only make one kind of antibody, made up of heavy and light protein chains arranged in a Y-shape, camelids produce two,\u201d the entry stated. \u201cOne of these is very similar to a human antibody. The other, called a single-domain antibody, VHH, or nanobody, does not have any light-chain proteins. This makes it much smaller, which is a boon to researchers.\u201d\nIn 2016, with the support of the National Institutes of Health, the researchers narrowed in on coronaviruses. Seven such viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, infect humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most of people will catch at least one in their lifetimes and experience cold-like symptoms. Meanwhile, a smaller population may suffer severe and sometimes fatal infections from coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1, which caused the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, or MERS-CoV.\nEnter Winter, who was 9 months old at the time. Researchers vaccinated her with spike proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to see how her immune system would react, according to a news release\u00a0and the award entry. The NIH explained the experiment like this:\n[Spike protiens] latch onto cells, then undergo a structural change that allows the virus to fuse with the cell. Once the virus enters the host cell, it can copy itself and produce more viruses. The nanobodies that the scientists harvested from the llama bloodstream and produced in the lab bound to the spike protein and prevented the virus from entering cells.\n[Spike protiens] latch onto cells, then undergo a structural change that allows the virus to fuse with the cell. Once the virus enters the host cell, it can copy itself and produce more viruses. The nanobodies that the scientists harvested from the llama bloodstream and produced in the lab bound to the spike protein and prevented the virus from entering cells.\nFlash forward to early 2020, the beginning of the ongoing pandemic.\nThe researchers immediately realized that the small llama antibodies \u201cthat could neutralize SARS would very likely also recognize the COVID-19 virus,\u201d Xavier Saelens, the leader of the Ghent research center, told The New York Times\u00a0in May 2020.\n\u201cThere is still a lot of work to do to try to bring this into the clinic,\u201d he added. \u201cIf it works, llama Winter deserves a statue.\u201d\nIn other words, the team \u2014 which included\u00a0Daniel Wrapp, a then-structural biologist at\u00a0McLellan\u2019s lab \u2014 used Winter\u2019s antibodies engineered during the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV experiments four years earlier to see how, or if, they would bind to the spike protein of the recently discovered coronavirus, according to news reports at the time.\nIf so, that process would effectively block the coronavirus from infecting more healthy cells \u2014 in turn, showing the potential to protect COVID-19 patients from getting sicker.\n\u201cInitial tests indicate that the antibody blocks viruses that display this spike protein from infecting cells in culture,\u201d the researchers announced via a statement.\nAs a result, the Belgium center established a company, ExeVir Bio, to launch clinical trials. And, on Aug. 18, 2021, those agencies announced in a statement:\n\u201cThe first subjects have been dosed in a Phase I clinical study of XVR011, its llama-derived antibody for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.\u201d\nIn other words, yes, researchers indeed immunized a group of unidentified people with a formula containing the llama\u2019s antibodies to see how their immune system would respond. Those participants were chosen at random and among counterparts who received a placebo shot, according to the statement. Going forward, project leaders were prepared to administer additional doses to a \u201cmaximum of three groups of 10 healthy adult subjects\u201d as part of the Phase I trial.\nDominique Tersago, chief medical officer of ExeVir, told Reuters that the technology could be a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d Ultimately, she said they\u2019re hoping to create an IV treatment that would be available to immune-compromised people in clinics or severely ill COVID-19 patients in hospitals.\nConsidering that evidence, we rate this claim \u201cTrue\u201d \u2014 with the caveat that the research was preliminary and ongoing, and the actual extent to which llama-derived antibodies could help COVID-19 patients on a grand scale remained unknown.\nSources:"}

According to the project team:\nBased on astronomical observations, \u2018Oumuamua turned out to have highly anomalous properties that defy well-understood natural explanations. We can only speculate whether \u2018Oumuamua may be explained by never seen before natural explanations, or by stretching our imagination to \u2018Oumuamua perhaps being an extraterrestrial technological object, similar to a very thin light-sail or communication dish, which fits the astronomical data rather well.\nAfter the recent release of the ODNI (Office of the Director of National Intelligence) report on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), the scientific community now needs the determination to systematically, scientifically and transparently look for potential evidence of extraterrestrial technological equipment. The impact of any discovery of extraterrestrial technology on science and on our entire world view would be enormous.\nBased on astronomical observations, \u2018Oumuamua turned out to have highly anomalous properties that defy well-understood natural explanations.

In mid-July, the country\u2019s meteorological agency released a video of cars driving through a downpour, which they said was the result of their testing drones to increase rainfall.\nThis is part of ongoing efforts in the Gulf state to battle rising temperatures and dwindling water supplies.

Dubbed the \u201cConnoisseur of Pain\u201d by the Entomological Society of America, the American bug scientist has been stung hundreds of times over in his career.\u00a0\nBut the pain was not without purpose. Schmidt\u2019s poking and prodding would ultimately lead to a scientific categorization of his painful experiences. The Schmidt Sting Pain Index ranks the level of pain administered by being stung by an insect of the order Hymenopteran, which includes bees, wasps, and ants.\u00a0\nSchmidt recorded his own experience of venomous stings to rate and describe the pain associated with the venom of certain insects, according to the Natural History Museum.\nIn his 1983 work in the peer-reviewed journal, Archives of the Insect Biochemistry and Physiology, Schmidt published a column comparing the properties of insect venoms and rated sting pain starting from 0 (ineffective on humans) to progress in .5 increments. He would go on to expand on this list in 1990, adding the classification of 78 insect stings to be published in the Encyclopedia of Entomology.\u00a0\nTake the red fire ant, for example. With a pain level of 1, its sting was characterized as sharp, sudden, and mildly alarming: \u201cLike walking across a shag carpet and reaching for the light switch.\u201d\u00a0\nBumping up to level 2, we see the western honey bee whose sting is described as \u201cburning, corrosive, but you can handle it. A flaming match head lands on your arm and is quenched with lye and then with sulphuric acid.\u201d\u00a0\nIf you think that sounds bad then you clearly haven\u2019t been stung by the tarantula hawk, which clocks in at a whopping 4 on the index scale \u2014 the highest rating.\u00a0\nWith a sting that is blinding, fierce, and shockingly electric, Schmidt compares getting poked by the 2-inch flying insect as akin to \u201ca running hair dryer [that] has just been dropped into your bubble bath.\u201d\u00a0\nNot doing it for you? How about the \u201cpure, intense, brilliant pain\u201d of the bullet ant, which is \u201clike walking over flaming charcoal with a 3-inch nail embedded in your heel.\u201d\u00a0\nIt sounds like a painful job, but apparently, someone had to do it. For his seemingly intolerable work, Schmidt was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in Physiology and Entomology in 2015.. The Ig Nobels are awarded for science published in peer-reviewed journals to recognize \u201cachievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think.\u201d Aside from poking fun at academic research, the goal of the IG Nobels is to inspire an interest in science, medicine, and technology.\nAt the time of this writing, Schmidt was listed as an entomologist and adjunct scientist at the University of Arizona College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.\u00a0"}

As it turns out, Australia is home to at least seven pink-hued lakes, some of which are found inland and others that are nestled against the white sand beaches of the South Pacific.\u00a0 \u00a0\nPerhaps best known is Lake Hilliar. First discovered in 1802 by navigator Matthew Flinders, the lake is located on Middle Island off of the coast of Western Australia. Like the other pink lakes of Australia, it is believed that Lake Hilliar\u2019s vibrant pink color is the result of microalgae called Dunaliella salina. The salt-loving algae produce carotenoids \u2014 the same pigment found in carrots \u2014 that could help to explain how the lake gets its pink color. According to a 1987 study published in the Journal of Arid Environments, the water of some lakes can turn pink during the warm and dry months of the year when brine concentrations are highest. As water evaporates from the surface of the lake, and the body of water increases in salinity, D. salina develops its reddish pigment.\u00a0\nResearchers with the U.S.-based Extreme Microbiome Project, a scientific effort to characterize extremophiles and novel organisms, studied sediment and water samples from the lake to better understand the organisms that call it home.\u00a0\n\u201cWhile the pink color is thought to be caused by salt-loving algae, the actual microbial composition of the lake is unknown,\u201d wrote Ken McGrath, national sequencing manager at the Australian Research Facility. \u201cThe analysis revealed a surprising range of microbial diversity in the lake, and indicates that many algal, bacterial, and archaeal halophiles contribute to the persistent pigmentation of this pink paradise.\u201d\nMcGrath and his team genetically sequenced organisms found in the lake using what is known as metagenomics \u2013 the \u201cfishing net\u201d of genomics that captures everything in the sample, not just the fishing rod looking at a specific question.\u00a0\nA \u201cbigger picture\u201d of what was in the lake revealed that while D. salina is the dominant bacteria in the lake; other archaea \u2014 unicellular organisms like bacteria that make up a different branch of the tree of life \u2014 were also found in abundant numbers, including salt-loving species and subspecies.\nThat same year, SciShow host Hank Green described this process as a special adaptation that allowed these microscopic organisms to survive in an otherwise inhospitable environment.\u00a0\u00a0\nThough the exact mechanism behind Australia\u2019s pink lakes is not completely known, scientists are beginning to understand how such hues can be found naturally on Earth.\u00a0"}

And the reservoir connected to the dam is capable of holding such a high volume of water that it is rumored to slow and change the rotation of the Earth.\nThe rumor has been in circulation for more than a decade, and turns out, it\u2019s true. The rumor was fact-checked by Business Insider (BI) in June 2010 and has been reiterated over the years in variations of social media posts and a number of publications that made similar claims. In general, the claim asserted that once the reservoir of the dam was filled, the weight of the mass would be enough to slightly shift the rotation of the Earth. According to BI:\nThat water will weigh more than 39 trillion kilograms (42 billion tons). A shift in a mass of that size will impact the rotation of the Earth due to a phenomena known as \u201cthe moment of inertia\u201d, which is the inertia of a rigid rotating body with respect to its rotation. The moment of inertia of an object about a given axis describes how difficult it is to change its angular motion about that axis. The longer the distance of a mass to its axis of rotation, the slower it will spin. You may not know it, but you see examples of this in everyday life. For example, a figure skater attempting to spin faster will draw her arms tight to her body, and thereby reduce her moment of inertia. Similarly, a diver attempting to somersault faster will bring his body into a tucked position.\nRaising 39 trillion kilograms of water 175 meters above sea level will increase the Earth\u2019s moment of inertia, and thus slow its rotation. However, the impact will be extremely small. NASA scientists calculated the shift of such a mass will increase the length of day by only 0.06 microseconds, and make the Earth only very slightly more round in the middle and more flat on the top. It will also shift the pole position by about two centimeters (0.8 inch). Note that a shift in any object\u2019s mass on the Earth relative to its axis of rotation will change its moment of inertia, although most shifts are too small to be measured (but they can be calculated).\nThat water will weigh more than 39 trillion kilograms (42 billion tons). A shift in a mass of that size will impact the rotation of the Earth due to a phenomena known as \u201cthe moment of inertia\u201d, which is the inertia of a rigid rotating body with respect to its rotation.

The dimensions and logistics noted in the above post are accurate. The dam was built along the Yangtze River and has a generating capacity of 22,500 megawatts \u2013 almost four times as much as the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in Washington. Measuring nearly 600 feet tall and running almost 1.5 miles long, the dam creates the Three Gorges Reservoir, which has a surface area of 400 square miles and extends upstream from the dam 370 miles, according to the U.S. Geological Service.\nSnopes contacted NASA, which confirmed that the claim had originated in a Jet Propulsion Lab report published in June 2005. Scientists compared the effects of the dam to the Dec. 26, 2004, Indonesian earthquake, which prompted a tsunami that killed nearly 230,000 people.\nThrough a process known as the \u201cmoment of inertia,\u201d the quake was found to have decreased the length of the day by 2.68 microseconds and Earth\u2019s oblateness (flattening on the top and bulging at the equator) decreased by about one part in 10 billion. But to understand how this works, we need to explain the physical properties.\nShifts in mass like those resulting from earthquakes or reservoirs affect the rotation of the earth because of what is known as the moment of inertia, or rotational inertia. In the case of the dam, the moment of Earth\u2019s inertia depends on its mass (water) and the distribution of that mass relative to the axis of rotation (i.e., the relocation of the water from other areas to the reservoir), according to the Khan Academy. The Earth\u2019s axis is an imaginary pole that runs through the center of Earth from \u201ctop\u201d to \u201cbottom,\u201d noted NASA. Earth spins around this pole and makes one full rotation each day complete with a day and a night. But as mass moves on the planet, this shift can slightly alter the rotation, and thus the length of days, on Earth.\nUnderstanding the moment of inertia is also understandable when looking at a spinning top \u2013 an evenly distributed top will be able to better spin, but when mass changes, the rotation and spinning of an object also changes.\nThe phenomenon is not abnormal \u2014 a shift in any object\u2019s mass on earth relative to the axis of rotation will change a moment of inertia, though most are too small to be measured. Earth\u2019s rotation can be changed based on any of its dynamic processes, from winds and atmospheric pressures to earthquakes and glaciation \u2014 any time a large mass moves from one location on the planet to another. Rotational shifts were observed during the major earthquakes in Chile in 2010 and in Japan in 2011, both of which increased the Earth\u2019s spin and hence decreased the length of the day.\nIn the 2005 NASA report, scientists argued raising enough water above sea level to fill the Three Gorges Reservoir would also increase Earth\u2019s moment of inertia and thus slow its rotation \u2014 a small shift of about .06 microseconds per day, making the planet slightly more round in the middle and flat on top.\n\u201cIf filled, the gorge would hold 40 cubic kilometers (10 trillion gallons) of water. That shift of mass would increase the length of day by only 0.06 microseconds and make the Earth only very slightly more round in the middle and flat on the top. It would shift the pole position by about two centimeters (0.8 inch),\u201d write the scientists.\nThe change in inertia would also shift the position of the poles by about .8 inch \u2013 again, a process that is not that foreign. While the Earth\u2019s poles reverse about every 200,000 to 300,000 years, the earth\u2019s pivoted axis causes the north and south poles to shift slightly and often. Notably, from 1999 to 2005, Earth\u2019s magnetic north pole went from shifting at most about 9 miles a year to as much as 37 miles in a year, according to a study published in the journal Nature Geoscience, and is expected to continue a trajectory toward Siberia.\nSo, while it may seem alarming to some that the construction of a dam and its subsequent reservoir has the capability to shift the Earth\u2019s axis and alter the length of days, the concept is a rather normal element of life on Earth."}

Homes, buildings, or roads don\u2019t crumble as a result, and the soil dips over a period of time. The technical term for this is subsidence, or \u201cthe slow-motion deflation of land that occurs when large amounts of water are withdrawn from deep underground, causing underlying sediments to fall in on themselves.\u201d\nLocated around 50 miles south of Fresno, the town is 7.47 square miles, with 21,960 residents, and each year, it sinks from a few inches to almost 2 feet. Portions of the town have sunk as much as 11.5 feet in some places.\u00a0\nThe primary cause of this sinking appears to be agriculture. For decades, agricultural companies have pumped out underground water to irrigate their crops, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) California Water Science Center. This occurs when surface water from rivers and canals are insufficient and farmers have to turn to groundwater for irrigation purposes, which is water under the surface that needs to be pumped out.\nNASA scientists have been tracking subsidence in Corcoran for years using radar and satellite technology. Satellite imagery showed that Corcoran has sunk only 4 feet in some areas since 2015, but a water management agency estimates that the area will sink another 6 to 11 feet over the next 19 years.\u00a0\nThe sinking resulted in a range of infrastructure problems for the residents of Corcoran and for farmers, including crushing the casings of four drinking-water wells used by the city. Re-drilling new wells costs hundreds of thousands of dollars pulled from city taxes. More than a million dollars was spent over a decade to construct lift stations that pumped water through ditches because the sinking land prevented water from flowing naturally. Farmers have borne those costs.\u00a0\nThis phenomenon is not limited to Corcoran. Subsidence is occurring in parts of Houston-Galveston in Texas, and in Arizona, Louisiana, and New Jersey.\u00a0\nCorcoran relies largely on agriculture with 30 percent of the town\u2019s working-age residents in the farming industry, and more than 30 percent of residents living in poverty. More details about the crisis can be read in a New York Times report here.\u00a0"}

At the time of this writing, the video had been upvoted more than 66,000 times.\n\nSnopes readers asked our team to verify whether it was true that hyalite opal glowed bright green under ultraviolet (UV) light, and we determined this to be true. Hyalite opal is a gemstone that was first characterized by German geologist Abraham Werner in 1794 while its uniquely fluorescing characteristics were described by Otto Fl\u00f6rke in in 1973 \u2014 and new classifications of the vibrant gem have been discovered in the decades since. In 2013, a new type known as Mexican hyalite opal was discovered in the Mexican State of Zacatecas, a geologically active region near the Sierra Madre Occidental Volcanic Province.\n\u201cThis material possesses spectacular color behavior, appearing near-colorless or pale-to-moderate yellow in incandescent light and vivid greenish-yellow to yellowish-green in indirect sunlight,\u201d wrote researchers describing the find in The Journal of Gemmology.\nHyalite opal is composed primarily of silica and is created through a series of volcanic processes deposited over millions of years from \u201csuper-volcanoes\u201d similar to those found in Yellowstone National Park. During eruptions, some lava that chills in a large depression known as a caldera create siliceous volcanic glass that is then shattered into tiny shards and settles with pumice fragments and volcanic ash to make what is known as \u201ctuff.\u201d Over time, these tuffs condense and mix with other materials, including silica and uranium, and settle into layers below the Earth\u2019s surface. Silica and uranium are eventually incorporated into emanating vapors and interact with emerging water from hot springs, and as they descend, eventually combine and redeposit as opal, chalcedony, or quartz.\u00a0\nThese trace amounts of uranium in the silica create a radioactive element that is both visible under UV light and detected with a Geiger counter, as seen in the below video shared by Indiana jeweler Moriarty\u2019s Gem Art:\u00a0\nOpal is generally known for its fluorescence when put under UV light, but Mexican hyalite opal is unique in that it can also fluoresce in natural light. These types of gems are \u201ctruly rare\u201d and after their discovery nearly a decade ago, they began attracting attention because of their \u201cnoticeable change\u201d from light colors to vivid green in indirect sunlight \u2014 a unique property that granted them the nickname, \u201cElectric Opal.\u201d\u00a0\nThe radioactivity level of hyalite opal is in background levels and does not pose harm to human health, but some items that include uranium can emit low levels of radiation for thousands of years, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This has been found to be the case in American products that were made to contain certain radioactive materials for their color-inducing or fluorescing properties before scientists largely understood the health effects of radiation.\u00a0\nTake \u201cVaseline glass.\u201d For centuries, glassmakers would use small amounts of uranium to create dish ware named for its yellow or green tint that, when put under a UV light, caused the glass to glow.\u00a0\n\u201cUranium has been incorporated as a coloring agent in glass since its discovery as a new mineral in 1789. The use of uranium for coloring glassware was especially popular from about 1910 to 1940 for light yellow Vaseline glass and dark green Depression glass,\u201d noted the Health Physics Society, a nonprofit science organization. \u201cThese pieces of glassware are now collectors\u2019 items found in antique shops everywhere.\u201d\u00a0\nBut the EPA largely prohibited U.S. glassmakers and ceramic producers from using radionuclides like uranium for color in 1970, according to the EPA.\u00a0"}
